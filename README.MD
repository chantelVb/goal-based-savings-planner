goal-based-savings-planner
The Goals Based Planner is created as an extention of my continued interest in Financial Planning. I wanted to create an application that combines Financial Goal setting whilst visually seeing the future result of achieving these goals. For many, seeing their financial goals as achievable by being broken down into managable steps is the first step to conquering large goals.

This system assumes the users is seeking a tool to assist them in visualising their financial goals, allowing them to fix a concrete timeframe to the monthly contributions they will need to make. This will be a visual first interface with graphs and timelines, exactly what the user will expect.

This system assumes the users will have at least one financial goal, although it can assist with several goals. If no goals exist the UI will prompt the user to add at least one goal.

The system assumes the users will have a target amount they will save for. This will allow the calculation Goal Amount / Monthly Contribution = Timeframe.

This system assumes the users can use a simple interface with clear instructions to input data. This allows the system to avoid tutorials or onboarding flows.

This system assumes the users understands monthly contributions. If not, there will be a (?) which can be hovered over, displaying a short description of what is meant by monthly contribution.

This system assumes the users will input realistic values. No negative numbers, and no billion pound values as there will be prompts to guide them. This will allow for lightweight validation.

This system assumes the users are not using legacy browsers as they will need to access the app via a modern browser which is javascript enabled.

This system assumes the users are not using the app offline. A stable internet is needed whilst accessing the app however, an offline ability can be added to display data but not to edit.

This system assumes the data input will either be a string or interger. The UI will display when the user is to input an interger to avoid confusion.

This system assumes the monthly contributions will be consistent over time. In the instances where they are not, the user can update the contributions and the system will recalculate the goal timeframe.

This system assumes monthly contributions are monthly. For those who are paid weekly and would prefer a weekly contributions option this can be added to the UI

This system assumes no interest, inflation or market volatility. This will be added in later versions.

This system does not predict the financial market

No machine learning is used in this version
